# Testing some code for Luke

Candidate answers:

## How long did you spend on this exercise?

60 minutes on the nose, but I was shifting as the npm installs over the Brav wifi took an age.

## What more would you do if you spent more time on it? (if your time was limited, this is an opportunity to explain your thinking and approach further)

Make the nav bar and search it's own component, use an subject between the search and styleViewer component rather than input params.
Better error handling.
Add a loading spinner.
Add a docker container.

## Explain why you took the approach that you did? e.g. why did you pick a particular library (or none at all)?

I'm very familiar with Angular and once you get going it's fast to develop in and the framework structure instills a level of architectural thinking from the start. However I spent a lot of time in setup that compressed the real meat of the work.

## Are there any known issues you'd like to flag?

Error detection isn't thoroughly tested, have only tested for `32gg`, `asdfasdf` and ` `. 

## How would you improve the API that you used?

Add a `sortBy` and `limit` option, it's also a bit slow.
